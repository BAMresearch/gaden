# GADEN
A 3D Gas Dispersion Simulator for Mobile Robot Olfaction in Realistic Environments

This ROS pkg presents a simulation framework to enable the validation of robotics systems and gas sensing algorithms 
under realistic environments. The framework is rooted in the principles of computational fluid dynamics and filament 
dispersion theory, modeling wind flow and gas dispersion in 3D real-world scenarios (i.e. accounting for walls, furniture, etc.). 
Moreover, it integrates the simulation of different environmental sensors, such as metal oxide gas sensors, photo ionization 
detectors, or anemometers. For further information, please see: [http://mapir.isa.uma.es/work/gaden](http://mapir.isa.uma.es/work/gaden)
